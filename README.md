# react-app

Components:

Frontend: React application
Backend: Node.js (Express)
Database: MySQL
Infrastructure: AWS EC2, Docker
Networking: Virtual Private Cloud (VPC), Security Groups
Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the architecture:

Frontend (Client Side)

Component: React Application
Host: Deployed on an AWS EC2 instance or served via a Content Delivery Network (CDN)
Access: Users access the frontend via a web browser over HTTP/HTTPS
Backend (Server Side)

Component: Node.js with Express.js
Host: Deployed on an AWS EC2 instance using Docker
Communication: Listens for HTTP requests on port 5001
Database

Component: MySQL Database
Host: Deployed on an AWS EC2 instance using Docker
Connection: Backend application connects to the MySQL instance to perform CRUD operations
Networking & Security

VPC (Virtual Private Cloud): Isolates your network resources
Subnets: Public and private subnets to segregate public-facing services from internal resources
Security Groups: Controls inbound and outbound traffic for EC2 instances
Docker

Containers: Each component (frontend, backend, database) runs in its own Docker container
Docker Compose: Orchestrates multi-container Docker applications

Description of Components
Frontend (React App):

Hosted on an EC2 instance or CDN.
Communicates with the backend via HTTP/HTTPS requests.
Backend (Node.js / Express):

Runs on an EC2 instance inside a Docker container.
Serves API endpoints that the frontend interacts with.
Database (MySQL):

Runs on an EC2 instance inside a Docker container.
Stores application data, such as user posts.
Load Balancer (Optional):

Distributes incoming HTTP/HTTPS requests across multiple frontend instances for high availability and load balancing.
VPC (Virtual Private Cloud):

A network within AWS where your EC2 instances and database are hosted.
Includes security groups to control access.
Steps to Deploy on AWS
Set Up EC2 Instances:

Launch EC2 instances for frontend, backend, and database.
Configure security groups to allow traffic on necessary ports (e.g., 80, 443, 5001).
Install Docker:

Install Docker on each EC2 instance.
Create Docker Images:

Build Docker images for your frontend, backend, and database.
Run Docker Containers:

Use docker run or docker-compose to start your containers on the respective EC2 instances.
Configure Networking:

Set up VPC, subnets, and security groups to control access and ensure proper communication between services.
Deploy Application:

Deploy your frontend code to the frontend instance.
Deploy your backend code to the backend instance.
Deploy the MySQL database to the database instance.
Testing:

Ensure that all components are properly communicating.
Test the entire workflow from the frontend through the backend to the database.
This setup ensures a scalable and modular architecture, with each component isolated in its container and managed via Docker.
